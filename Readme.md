# Doubly Linked List in Rust 🦀

A simple **doubly linked list** implemented in Rust, created for **learning and practice**.  
This project focuses on using `Rc<RefCell<>>` for shared ownership and interior mutability.

## 📚 Overview

This linked list supports:

- Insertion at the front (`push_front`)
- Insertion at the back (`push_back`)
- Removal of elements by value (`drop`)
- Custom `Debug` output for visualization

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is not optimized for production use — it's for educational purposes.
